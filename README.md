=============================================================

Methane emission study near Indianapolis (June 2013)
----------------------------------------------------

This repository contains an operating program for recording data from an
Applied Technology Inc (ATI) sonic anemometer (SATI-* series) using a 
[CR1000](http://www.campbellsci.com/cr1000) data logger from Campbell 
Scientific Inc (CSI). The program was prepared for a field campaign to
